      The world of IT can be scary and intimidating,but it doesn't have to be
      that way. If you have a grain of faith in YOU and can allocate 3-4 hours
      per day to study, YOU can achieve in 6 months what others are
      accomplishing in 4 years of College. Our curriculum is inspired from the
      real life corporate IT world, combined with all the cool new technologies.
      We primarily focus on Linux, Ansible, AWS and Kubernetes. But we also
      cover Docker, Git, Terraform, Python to name a few. After the technical
      level is achieved we guide our students through the interview process, as
      getting in the right set of mind is crucial to success
